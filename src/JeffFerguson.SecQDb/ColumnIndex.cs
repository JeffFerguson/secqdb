    /// A column index is a pairing of a list of zero-based column numbers and a
    /// dictionary. The dictionary is a collection of keys and values. The keys
    /// represent the text found in the given column, and the values are a list of
    /// file offsets containing the key text in the given column. Note that a piece
    /// of text in a column may appear in more than one record, so there may be more
    /// than one file offset. The file offsets allow code to quickly navigate to a
    /// record if the caller needs to find the records with given key text.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// The list of zero-based column numbers allow for composite keys to be built.
    /// In the simple case, the list will have one number in it, which would denote an
    /// index built for a single column. The list allows for multiple column numbers,
    /// which, in turn, allows for composite column indexing.

    /// The text files in SEC quarterly database packages can be several hundreds
    /// of megabytes in size, and loading all of the files into memory for that they
    /// can be queried when needed would add quite a bit of memory pressure. It
    /// seems more efficient to build offset-based indexes for each of the records
    /// and navigate to the records needed by processing only when the specific
    /// records are needed. Loading all of the records in all of the files is
    /// inefficient, especially since it is most likely that most of the records
    /// will not even be requested during processing.
