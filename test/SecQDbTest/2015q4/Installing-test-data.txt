The data set read by the unit tests is too large to be managed by GitHub. Before the tests can be run, you will
need to download and install the data manually. The process is simple:

1. Download the ZIP file at http://www.sec.gov/data/financial-statements/2015q4.zip.
2. Unzip the ZIP file and place its contents into the "test/SecQDbTest/2015q4" folder in the solution.

Your "test/SecQDbTest/2015q4" folder should contain the following files:

* installing-test-data.txt (this file)
* num.txt
* pre.txt
* readme.htm (not used by the tests but found in the ZIP file)
* sub.txt
* tag.txt

These files are listed in the .gitignore file for the repository, so they will not be committed to the repository
in any case.
